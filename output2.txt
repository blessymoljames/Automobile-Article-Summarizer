 Neutral Summary:
RS! However at Rs 8.69 lakh, ex-Delhi, the Baleno RS sits bang among the few performance hatchbacks (100PS+) we have in the country. But now, the company has a proper RS trim in the Baleno and we were invited to the BIC to drive it.The cars at the BIC were already warmed up for us by the good folk at Maruti. However, the carÂ still handles predictably. This also adds to the cost of the car.On to the drive experience then. The Baleno RS is also compliant with front offset, side impact and pedestrian safety crash tests. However, it debuts Maruti's first-ever turbo-petrol engine and will be a brand builder for future performance vehicles. Of course, there is an RS badge at the back too. This shows in the way the car handles.
