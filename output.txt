RS! However at Rs 8.69 lakh, ex-Delhi, the Baleno RS sits bang among the few performance hatchbacks (100PS+) we have in the country. But now, the company has a proper RS trim in the Baleno and we were invited to the BIC to drive it.The cars at the BIC were already warmed up for us by the good folk at Maruti. However, the car still handles predictably. This shows in the way the car handles. However, it debuts Maruti's first-ever turbo-petrol engine and will be a brand builder for future performance vehicles. This also adds to the cost of the car.On to the drive experience then. However, we wish the motor sounded a tad more sporty at those speeds. The Baleno RS is also compliant with front offset, side impact and pedestrian safety crash tests. However, paying almost Rs 1.5 lakh over the regular 1.2l and without much improvement in the perceived performance of the vehicle is an overkill. Of course, there is an RS badge at the back too. The steering wheel also lets you know how much effort has to be put to make that corner, and the effort doesn't vary every time you take the same corner at the same speed.That being said, the steering, like all Maruti units, feels a bit heavy at low speeds. In the sense, the Baleno is a nice and sporty family hatchback.It has the looks, interior space, efficient and punchy motor, and the Maruti reliability. The badge holds high regard in any car enthusiast's heart. There is no sudden spike in the power delivery, and the linear approach adopted by Maruti will align with the family car appeal of the Baleno.On the straight at BIC, we saw 160kmph in fourth gear, with the tachometer needle nudging the 6,200rpm redline, before we had to brake for the corner. Maruti also haven't quoted any claimed 0-100kmph numbers, but the company did stress on the claimed fuel efficiency of 21.1kmpl.Maruti says that they have stiffened the shocks at the front to accommodate the extra weight of the engine. Although, we particularly like the different menus that the multi-information display showcases, including available power and torque graphs.The RS badge gives the Baleno brand a shot in the arm. Given the extra boost in power, the car comes with disc brakes on all four wheels. Speaking of which, this engine is an import from Suzuki's Japan plant and adds to about 60kg to the Baleno's overall weight (950kg). Maruti officials confirmed that the bonnet absorbs much of the crash impact, instead of passing it on to the pedestrian it has collided with.Maruti distinguishes the RS from its stablemate by using new sporty bumpers at the front and rear, chrome grille, side skirts, black alloys and an integrated spoiler. Maruti was supposed to get in the Swift RS, but what we got instead was the limited edition cosmetic-only trim in 2015. While we didn't have a chance to check the ride quality of the RS, expect it to retain the slightly firm ride quality that the car is known for. For the sake of photographs, we had to drive the car at 40kmph and it was happy doing it at third gear.
